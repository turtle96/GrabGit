# GrabGit

Done for CS3219 Assignment 5.

The objective of this assignment is to create a web application that allows developers to grab statistics from git repositories (hence the name GrabGit). These statistics serve to provide a measurement of productivity of the development team. By analysing these statistics, developers may improve their productivity by changing the workflow, management policies or team collaboration style etc. Team managers can also use this tool to keep track of the teamâ€™s overall progress and productivity.

## Web Link

Hosted on GitHub Pages: [GrabGit](https://turtle96.github.io/GrabGit/)

Note: The browser may block unsafe content because demo contains files load over mixed HTTP & HTTPS. You need to explicitly allow these script by clicking the 'shield' button on right-hand side of the addressbar (Google Chrome).
